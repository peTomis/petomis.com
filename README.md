## About The Project

The website is a single-page application that provides an overview of my skills, experience, and projects. It's designed to be simple, fast, and provide a snapshot of my work and capabilities in a clean, easy-to-understand format.

The main features of the website include:

- **Portfolio Carousel**: A carousel showcasing my best work. Each slide includes a brief description of the project and a link to either a live version or the project's source code (when available).

- **Contact Form**: A simple contact form that allows visitors to send me a message directly from the website. It includes fields for their name, email address, and their message. Upon submission, the form data is sent to my email.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work across a range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers, ensuring all visitors have a high-quality experience.
